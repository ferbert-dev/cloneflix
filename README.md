# About the projeckt

As part of the Modern Database Systems project, I independently developed Cloneflix, a clone of the Netflix platform that demonstrates how different databases can be used to perform specialized subtasks.

I built the backend using Spring Boot, gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing microservice-based architectures. I also set up the frontend with React and containerized the application using Docker to ensure smooth deployment.

For project organization, I managed the workflow using a Kanban board, which helped structure tasks and maintain progress effectively.

## Technology
Backend:
- Java 
- Spring Boot 
- Maven
- Neo4j for personal recommendations
- MongoDB for storing user, movie and series data
- Elasticsearch for full text search 

Frontend and Devops:
- React
- Docker
- Scrapy

## Features

- Registration and login as a user,
- Watch trailers and information about movies or series, 
- Save movies or series to favorites list to watch later,
- Like and unlike movies or series,
- Get recommendations for similar watched movies or series,
- Search movies or series by actor, title or genre.
